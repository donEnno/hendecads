# ALVIS - Explorative Analysis and Visualisation of Multiple Sequence Alignments #

## Installation: ##

* Pull the ALVIS repository using "git pull https://rfs@bitbucket.org/rfs/alvis.git" or download the binary release from the downloads section.
* In case of the latter, unzip the archive to a folder of your choice and execute the JAR using >> java -jar alvis.jar <<

## Requirements: ##

* Java 7
* OPTIONAL: R with a working rJava installation and the  "kernlab" package installed for some advanced features

## Troubleshooting: ##

* Should you encounter out-of-memory errors, start Alvis with the additional JVM command line switch -xMx4096 for 4GB of RAM (adjust to your system)
* Getting rJava to work can prove difficult. Please consult the rJava documentation for support, most Alvis features are available without it.

## Documentation ##

* A preliminary user guide is available inside the "doc" folder.
