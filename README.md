# Prediction of Hendecads

## Outline
### DeepCoil
- [ ] Benchmark DeepCoil on NPF data
- [ ] Benchmark DeepCoil + latest data on NPF data
- [ ] Benchmark DeepCoil + latest data + PT5 embedding on NPF data
- [ ] Benchmark DeepCoil + latest data + PT5 embedding + selected seq from NPF on NPF data

### PCOILS
- [ ] Benchmark PCOILS on NPF data

### NPF Data Analysis
- [ ] Method to assess "Hendecadness" in NPF data

The goal is to separate hendecads from other 11-repeat motifs by analyzing specific AA patterns like presence/absence of Prolines, hydrophobic residues in expected positions, ...

## General Considerations
- [ ] Find "universal" way of estimating and visualzing performances
- [ ] Find "universal" way of handling data (data must fit pipeline, not vice versa)
